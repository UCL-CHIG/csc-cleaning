# CSC cleaning scripts

These are R scripts that carry out cleaning on the children's social care (CSC) data (children looked after (CLA) and children in need (CiN)) in [ECHILD](https://www.echild.ac.uk/). The scripts result in more-or-less analysis ready datasets, though users should insepct the scripts and documentation for further details and consider whether any further cleaning is required.
