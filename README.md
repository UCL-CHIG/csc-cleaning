# CSC cleaning scripts

These are R scripts that carry out cleaning on the children's social care (CSC) data (children looked after (CLA) and children in need (CiN)) in [ECHILD](https://www.echild.ac.uk/). The scripts result in more-or-less analysis ready datasets that should suit most users, though users should insepct the scripts and documentation for further details and consider whether any further cleaning is required.

These scripts are applied to CSC data as supplied by DfE which includes all episodes (not just the latest in year) and includes episodes with and without PMR. The scripts could therefore be used outside of ECHILD and could be adapted for the more restricted extracts that are sometimes made available.
